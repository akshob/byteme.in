Hi there, welcome to our blog! We are Akshob and Apoorva, a couple who share a passion for exploring the world and learning new things. Our blog is a platform where we share our life experiences, travel stories, technology insights, and most importantly, our learnings.

We are individuals who lived in different parts of the world. We were going through a tough time as the world was grappling with the pandemic that hit in early 2020. 

We started talking over a video call. We found solace in each other's company and started talking every day. We shared our experiences, our fears, and our dreams with each other. Even though we were miles apart, we felt a strong connection.

As the pandemic progressed, it became clear that meeting in person was not going to be possible for a while. However, the video calls allowed us to continue our conversations and get to know each other better. We would have virtual dates, watch movies together, and even cook meals while on a video call.

Months passed, and eventually, our families decided to meet each other. It was awkward at first, but soon they all warmed up to each other.

Finally, in late 2020, we got to meet each other in person. It was as if we had known each other forever. We both knew that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. In December 2020, we tied the knot in a grand ceremony.

The pandemic had affected everyone in different ways, but it brought us together. The video calls allowed us to spend time together, even though we were miles apart. We had learned to communicate, to be patient, and to be there for each other in difficult times. We knew that we had found someone special.
